This example utilizes the PLBerkelium plugin, https://github.com/PixelLightCommunity/Plugins/tree/master/PLBerkelium

You can also use this example with the PLAwesomium plugin (https://github.com/PixelLightCommunity/Plugins/tree/master/PLAwesomium),
this because PLBerkelium and PLAwesomium practically are identical in their methods.
